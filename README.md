## Overview

Problem: Sleep disorders are increasingly common, but early detection is often difficult. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a disorder using behavioral and health-related features.

Solution: The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and building classification models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrices, and other metrics.

Impact: Helps identify high-risk individuals and understand key factors influencing sleep quality.

## Dataset
